        <p>Hey! I'm Evie Perren.
 
                I love to travel, visit new places and take on new experiences.
                 
                I'm currently working in the Contact Center of SimplyHealth whilst learning how to code and create sleek websites with a frictionless UX.
                 
                I've currently got my teeth stuck into advanced HTML, CSS & Javascript training to help to continue my learning.
                 
                Outside of travelling & coding, I'm a serious foodie. I love trying new foods from all parts of the world and *badly* re-creating these at home.</p>

                    <h5>In school...</h5>
        <p>I loved to ice skate, I competed in multiple competitions in my early teens which was my first experience in a competitive environment. More than anything I found I was a perfectionist, I was eager to complete every spin/turn/jump as best as I could.  </p></div>

                <h5>At College...</h5>
        <p>At college I was intrigued by one of my favourite classes, Psychology. Whilst I've never wanted to be a phycologist, I loved learning about the way the mind works and how people react to different situations. This is something that I've been able to translate into coding and building websites as the UX is such an integral part of a websites success.  </p></div></div>

                     <h5>Now...</h5>
         <p>I started coding in May 2018 and fell in love with the technical aspect of combining CSS with HTML & Javascript. The nerdy satisfaction I get from completing a task and seeing an idea come to life is also one of my favourite parts of coding and website design.  </p></div>

        <h4>My Family</h4>
        <div class="span-4-of-6">
        <p>Family is a huge part of my life, they have been super supportive through all of my learning & career endeavours.
 
                This is my Mum - she's a crazy cat, but I love her to bits. She has always been super career-driven, which is something I think I've inherited from her. We absolutely LOVE to binge Netflix series together!
                 
                This is my Step-Dad - he's a super loving character that pushes me to be the best I can be. He's been a father figure in my life since the age of 4 and I'm super grateful for everything he's done for me. He's a big animal buff and we love to watch movies together!
                 
                This is my Sister - she's super career driven too, up until recently she was working in London at a marketing agency completing her apprenticeship and learning the ropes of a new profession. I LOVE to wear her clothes, but I don't think she likes that too much...
                 
                These are my three puppies - Boris, Cindy & Angel. They are prince & princesses in their own right but we all love them to pieces, they light up the house and keep everyone on our toes. </p>
