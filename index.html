        <p>My name is Evie Perren and I am 19 years old. Currently working in the Contact Center of Simplyhealth and learning how to make exciting websites in my free time. I love the process of making websites come to life. I live at home with my family, and my 3 chihuahuas. But hoping to move out soon! I love to travel and visit new places as much as possible</p>

                    <h5>In school...</h5>
        <p>I wanted to be a professional figure skater. I took part in competitions when was 13. I didn't win anything but really enjoyed the learning process and making a performance come together. Sadly, I had to stop this as it became very expensive and I was close to starting my GCSES. </p></div>

        <p>When I started college, we brought a puppy. His name is Boris and is a long haired chihuahua. I loved to walk him in my free periods at college, and style his fur as much as I was allowed. We then were kindly given his mum and his sister.   </p></div></div>

        <div class="span-4-of-6">
        <p>My family are a massive part of my life, even if they drive me crazy on occasion. My Mum has always had a career head, and been such an inspiration for self learning as she was able to get a degree whilst working full time and supporting a family! Dad is actually my step-dad, but has been in my life since i was 4 - so wouldn't change him for the world. Liv and i have a classic sibling relationship, with arguements mainly about wearing each other's clothes. And of course, the dogs are a massive part of our family and always bring lots of noise to the house. </p>
